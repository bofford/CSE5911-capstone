Kinect Rehab project

Hey guys, here is what you'll need to know to get started on github:

0. Make a github account if you haven't already. 
1. if you're on Windows - download SourceTree (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. if you're not on Windows, you can't download the Kinect SDK, so yeah. 
3. fork this repo/project with the "fork" button in the top right corner.
  - this will become your copy of the project to work on. 
4. Link sourceTree to your github
