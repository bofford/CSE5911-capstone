Kinect Rehab project

Hey guys, here is what you'll need to know to get started on github:

0. Make a github account if you haven't already. 
1. Download SourceTree (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) 
2. fork this repo/project with the "fork" button in the top right corner.
  - this will become your copy of the project to work on. 
3. Link sourceTree to your github [I haven't even done this yet - Steve]
